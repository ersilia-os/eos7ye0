Title: ChemFH chemical frequent hitter detection
Description: ChemFH is an integrated model for the detection of frequent hitters
  in chemical screening across various parameters, including colloidal 
  aggregates, firefly luciferase reporter enzyme inhibition, fluorescence, 
  chemical reactivity, and promiscuity, as well as classical PAINS alerts and 
  others. ChemFH contains ChemProp models as well as rule-based filters based on
  liable substructures.

Task: Annotation
Subtask: Property calculation or prediction
Input:
  - Compound
Input Dimension: 1
Output:
  - Value
  - Score
Output Dimension: 17
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: Probability scores range from 0 to 1, with higher values 
  indicating a greater likelihood of being a frequent hitter. A threshold of 0.5
  is commonly used to classify compounds as frequent hitters (scores >= 0.5) or 
  non-frequent hitters (scores < 0.5).
