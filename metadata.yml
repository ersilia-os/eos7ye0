Title: ChemFH chemical frequent hitter detection
Description: ChemFH is an integrated model for the detection of frequent hitters in
  chemical screening across various parameters, including colloidal aggregates, firefly
  luciferase reporter enzyme inhibition, fluorescence, chemical reactivity, and promiscuity,
  as well as classical PAINS alerts and others.
